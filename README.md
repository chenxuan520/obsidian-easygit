3. It can optionally open the icon in the left column for easier operation

4. It won't do anything extra (other than instructions)

- git commit, commit your source and push to remote(if has remote)

- git pull, pull down from remote

- git push, manual push

- that's all...

## Setting

- toggle of left column buttom

- that's all...

## Notes

1. because this plugin is very easy and rudimentary,so you'd better can be proficient in using git

2. perhaps best used by programmers
